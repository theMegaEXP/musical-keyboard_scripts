## Musical Keyboard Scripts

Here are the scripts that are used so far in a [Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/introduction_to_godot.html) game I am making, currently called Musical Keyboard. As the game development progresses, more scripts will be added here to demonstrate with code the progress so far.

# About
Musical Keyboard, the name I have given for now, will be a typing game where you have to press falling keyboard keys in time to music.

# Level Editor
This game has a level editor so levels can be easily created and edited. However, the look and feel of the level editor will need to be improved if it ever becomes a main part of the game. For now, the level editor is a way for me to quickly create levels.

# Current Progress
Currently, the the main parts of the game are functional. Currently I am creating levels with the level editor. There is not yet a proper GUI to select the levels to play. Once some levels are finished, I will work on the main menu part of the GUI so levels can be selected and played.
